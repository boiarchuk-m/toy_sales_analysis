## Project description
In this project, I delve into sales analysis to unlock valuable insights to optimize sales performance for a retail company.

### About the dataset 
The dataset consists of several tables: sales, products, stores, and Inventory. These tables contain historical sales data, prices, product names and categories, store names and locations, and the number of items left in stock.

The dataset was taken from Maven analytics website: https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground

### Business Task
    1. Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?

    2. Which stores bring the biggest profit?

    3. Can you find any seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data?

    4. Are sales being lost with out-of-stock products at certain locations?

    6. How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores? How long will it last?

#### Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?

There are 35 different products and five categories. The biggest number of products are in the  **toys** category.

#### Can you find any seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data?
